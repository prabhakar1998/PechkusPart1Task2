Pechkus invoices are made in real time at the time of placement of order. But Today, it didn't happen. Now you have an Excel File (orders.xlsx) which has a list of all the order placed in last 1 hour along with other relevant details. You're required to make a Python Script to convert these orders to invoice.xlsx file. Each invoive.xlsx file contains 2 different invoices. In test case you're given 10 orders. Your solution should be valid for 'n' number of such orders. Final Output for test case should contain 5 invoice files i.e. 10 invoices in total.  


Points to Remember:
You're provided a sample invoice.xlsx file. 
Final Output should be in same format. 
You are advised to stay cautious regarding orders which have more than one lineitems.
Order Number and Invoice Number are same.
orders.xlsx contains Abbreviation for State Names but Invoice should contain state name. state.xlsx contains dictionary for that.
GST codes for different states can be found in GST.xlsx
HSN/SAC field should always be filled with 6101 in invoice.xlsx.
